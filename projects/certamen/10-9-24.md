Today, I worked on implementing a **progress tracking feature** for the Certamen App. This feature visually displays a user's study progress, showing the number of completed, in-progress, and unstarted lessons for each category.

## Changes Made
1. Added progress bars to the `StudyBox` component to represent user progress.
2. Used Tailwind CSS to create a dynamic, color-coded progress bar that updates based on user data.
3. Updated the Firebase database schema to store lesson statuses (`completed`, `in-progress`, `unstarted`).
4. Ensured that the progress bar dynamically updates whenever the user completes a lesson.

## Challenges
The biggest challenge was calculating the progress dynamically while ensuring that the UI remained performant. To solve this:
- I added a helper function in the `/lib` folder to compute progress percentages.
- Used React's `useEffect` to trigger re-renders only when lesson data changes.

## Technologies Used
- Tailwind CSS for styling the progress bar.
- Firebase for real-time data updates.
- React hooks (`useEffect`, `useState`) for dynamic updates.

## Outcome
The feature works smoothly! Users now have a clear visual indicator of their study progress, which is both motivating and informative.

## What's Next?
Next, I plan to add a hover tooltip to each progress bar segment to display detailed stats (e.g., the number of lessons completed). Stay tuned!
