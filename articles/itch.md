I itch to write. Almost two months have passed and I haven't finished a single piece.

It's not even that I have too many commitments or responsibilities. I suppose I just don't use the time I have properly. Slivers of ten minutes here, five there, ultimately unused and spent mindlessly idling away. Or a two hour chunk I dedicated towards writing but then decided I deserved some fun. 

Isn't this fun? Isn't this an escape? So why can't I bring myself to finish what I've already conceived? The blossoms are there, but I lack the bees to bring them to fruition. Or rather, the fruits are there, but all the low-hanging ones are gone and I'm too short to pick the rest. 

There we go again --- chalking it up to factors we can't control. I can't control my height, so not being able to pick the fruit is not my fault. I can't control the workload I have, so not having enough time is not my fault. Bullshit. Of course it's yours.

I seriously need to finish that one (or two) novel(s). And that speech. And that other speech. 

And that app for a club. And that app for another club. And that app for fun.

I itch to write. I'll grow the hands I need to scratch that bite if I have to.

Also I need to fix my life. Seriously, this time. It's embarrassing. Do better because you can.

See you in the next one, hopefully by then I can say that the flowers of the tree have turned into fruits in my basket.
